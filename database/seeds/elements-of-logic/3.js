Also figure to yourself a number of persons walking
behind this wall, and carrying with them statues of men,
and images of other animals, wrought in wood and stone
and all kinds of materials, together with various other
articles, which overtop the wall ; and, as you might
expect, let some of the passers-by be talking, and others
silent.

MYSTICISM AND LOGIC *

You are describing a strange scene, and strange
prisoners.

They resemble us, I replied.

Now consider what would happen if the course of
nature brought them a release from their fetters, and a
remedy for their foolishness, in the following manner.
Let us suppose that one of them has been released, and
compelled suddenly to stand up, and turn his neck round
and walk with open eyes towards the light ; and let us
suppose that he goes through all these actions with pain,
and that the dazzling splendour renders him incapable of
discerning those objects of which he used formerly to see
the shadows. What answer should you expect him to
make, if some one were to tell him that in those days he
was watching foolish phantoms, but that now he is some
what nearer to reality, and is turned towards things more
real, and sees more correctly ; above all, if he were to
point out to him the several objects that are passing by,
and question him, and compel him to answer what they
are ? Should you not expect him to be puzzled, and to
regard his old visions as truer than the objects now forced
upon his notice ?

Yes, much truer. . . .

Hence, I suppose, habit will be necessary to enable him
to perceive objects in that upper world. At first he will
be most successful in distinguishing shadows ; then he
will discern the reflections of men and other things in
water, and afterwards the realities ; and after this he will
raise his eyes to encounter the light of the moon and stars,
finding it less difficult to study the heavenly bodies and
the heaven itself by night, than the sun and the sun s light
by day.

Doubtless.

Last of all, I imagine, he will be able to observe and

contemplate the nature of the sun, not as it appears in
water or on alien ground, but as it is in itself in its own
territory.

Of course.

His next step will be to draw the conclusion, that the
sun is the author of the seasons and the years, and the
guardian of all things in the visible world, and in a manner
the cause of all those things which he and his companions
used to see.

Obviously, this will be his next step. . . .`;
