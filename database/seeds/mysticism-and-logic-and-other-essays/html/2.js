<h2>MYSTICISM AND LOGIC 3</h2>

<p>
The comparison of this statement, which is mystical,
with the one quoted by Plato, which is scientific, shows
how intimately the two tendencies are blended in the
system of Heraclitus. Mysticism is, in essence, little
more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in
regard to what is believed about the universe ; and this
kind of feeling leads Heraclitus, on the basis e&gt;f his science,
to strangely poignant sayings concerning life and the
world, such as :
</p>

<p>
" Time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is
a child s."
</p>

<p>
It is poetic imagination, not science, which presents
Time as despotic lord of the world, with all the irrespon-
~ible frivolity of a child. It is mysticism, too, which
leads IleTaeiitus to assert the identity of opposites :
" Good and ill are one," he says ; and again : " To God
all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some
things wrong and some right."
</p>

<p>
Much of mysticism underlies the ethics of Heraclitus.
It is true that a scientific determinism alone might have
inspired the statement : " Man s character is his fate " ;
but only a mystic would have said :
</p>

<p>
" Every beast is driven to the pasture with blows " ;
and again :
</p>

<p>
" It is hard to fight with one s heart s desire. What
ever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul " ;
and again :
</p>

<p>
" Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by
which all things are steered through all things." 1
</p>

<p>
Examples might be multiplied, but those that have
been given are enough to show the character of the man :
the facts of science, as they appeared to him, fed the

flame in his soul, and in its light he saw into the depths
of the world by the reflection of his own dancing swiftly
penetrating fire. In such a nature we see the true union
of the mystic and the man of science the highest
eminence, as I think, that it is possible to achieve in the
world of thought.
</p>

<p>
In Plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the
mystic impulse is distinctly the stronger of the two, and
secures ultimate victory whenever the conflict is sharp.
His description of the cave is the classical statement of
belief in a knowledge and reality truer and more real
than that of the senses :
</p>

<p>
" Imagine 1 a number of men living in an underground
cavernous chamber, with an entrance open to the light,
extending along the entire length of the cavern, in which
they have been confined, from their childhood, with their
legs and necks so shackled that they are obliged to &it
still and look straight forwards, because their chains
render it impossible for them to turn their heads round :
and imagine a bright fire burning some way off, above
and behind them, and an elevated roadway passing
between the fire and the prisoners, with a low wall built
along it, like the screens which conjurors put up in front
of their audience, and above which they exhibit their
wonders.</p>
