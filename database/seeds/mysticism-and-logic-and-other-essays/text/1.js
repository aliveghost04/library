MYSTICISM AND LOGIC

METAPHYSICS, or the attempt to conceive the
world as a whole by means of thought, has been
developed, from the first, by the union and conflict of
two very different human impulses, the one urging men
towards mysticism, the other urging them towards
science. Some men have achieved greatness through
one of these impulses alone, others through the other
alone : in Hume, for example, the scientific impulse
reigns quite unchecked, while in Blake a strong hostility
to science co-exists with profound mystic insight. But
the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt
the need both of science arid of mysticism : the attempt
to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what
always must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make
philosophy, to some minds, a greater thing than either
science or religion.

Before attempting an explicit characterisation of the
scientific and the mystical impulses, I will illustrate
them by examples from two philosophers whose great
ness lies in the very intimate blending which they
achieved. The two philosophers I mean are Herac&ius
and Plato.



* MYSTICISM AND LOGIC

Heraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in
universal flux : time builds and destroys all things.
From the few fragments that remain, it is not easy to
discover how he arrived at his opinions, but there are
some sayings that strongly suggest scientific observation
as the source.

" The things that can be seen, heard, and learned/ he
says, " are what I prize the most." This is the language
of the empiricist, to whom observation is the sole guaran
tee of truth. " The sun is new every day," is another
fragment ; and this opinion, in spite of its paradoxical
character, is obviously inspired by scientific reflection,
and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of
understanding how the sun can work its way under
ground from west to east during the night. Actual
observation must also have suggested to him his central
doctrine, that Fire is the one permanent substance, of
which all visible things are passing phases. In com
bustion we see things change utterly, while their flame
and heat rise up into the air and vanish.

" This world, which is the same for all," he says, " no
one of gods or men has made ; but it was ever, is now,
and ever shall be, an ever-living Fire, with measures
kindling, and measures going out."

" The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea ; and
half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind."

This theory, though no longer one which science can
accept, is nevertheless scientific in spirit. Science, too,
might have inspired the famous saying to which Plato
alludes : " You cannot step twice into the same rivers ;
for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you." But we
find also another statement among the extant fragments :
" We step and do not step into the same rivers ; we are
and are not." `;
