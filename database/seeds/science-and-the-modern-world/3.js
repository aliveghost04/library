which (upon Consequences) is censured by Socrates [Plato,
Parmen.] for obscurity and confusion. In his second part,

sophistical questions, so contrived, that the concession of some
point, that seemed unavoidable, immediately involved some
glaring absurdity. This, if it is to be esteemed as at all fall
ing within the province of Logic, is certainly not to be re
garded (as some have ignorantly or heedlessly represented il)
as its principal or proper business. The Greek philosophers
generally have unfortunately devoted too much attention to
it ; but we must beware of falling into the vulgar error of
supposing the ancients to have regarded as a serious and in
trinsically important study, that which in fact they considered
as an ingenious recreation. The disputants diverted them
selves in their leisure hours by making trial of their own and
their adversary s acuteness, in the endeavor mutually to per
plex each other with subtle fallacies ; much in the same way
as men amuse themselves with propounding and guessing rid
dles, or with the game of chess ; to each of which diversions
the sportive disputations of the ancients bore much resem
blance. They were closely anologous to the wrestling and
other exercises of the Gymnasium ; these last being reckoned
conducive to bodily vigor and activity, as the former were to
habits of intellectual acuteness ; but the immediate object in
each was a sportive, not a serious contest ; though doubtless
fashion and emulation often occasioned an undue importance
to be attached to success in each.

Zeno, then, is hardly to be regarded as any
further a logician than as to what respects his
erotctic method of disputation ; a course of argument con
structed on this principle being properly a hypothetical Sori
tes, which may easily be reduced into a series of syllogisms.

To Zeno succeeded Euclid of Megara, and

Antisthenes ; both pupils of Socrates. The
