made in earlier times. Indeed, those who first turned their
attention to the subject, hardly thought of inquiring into the
process of Reasoning itself, but confined themselves almost
entirely to certain preliminary points, the discussion of which
is (if logically considered) subordinate to that of the main
inquiry.

on Logic, of the technical terms introduced by from the
each and the senses in which each employed teaching of the

that were from time to time introduced, in short, to write
the History and Antiquities of Logical Science, would be
foreign to my present design. Such a work, if undertaken by
a competent writer, would be, though not of a popular char
acter, yet highly interesting and instructive to a limited class
of students. But the extensive research which would form
one indispensable qualification for such a task, would be only
one out of many, even less common, qualifications, without
which such a work would be worse than useless. The author
should be one thoroughly on his guard against the common
error of confounding together, or leading his readers to con
found, an intimate acquaintance with many books on a given
subject, and a clear insight into the subject itself. With
ability and industry for investigating a multitude of minute
particulars, he should possess the power of rightly estimating
each according to its intrinsic importance, and not (as is very
commonly done) according to the degree of laborious re
search it may have cost him, or the rarity of the knowledge
le may in any case have acquired. And he should be care
ful, while recording the opinions and expressions of various
authors on points of science, to guard both himself and hi*

readers against the mistake of taking any thing on authority
that ought to be evinced by scientific reasoning ; or of regard
ing each technical term as having a sort of prescriptive right
to retain forever the meaning attached to it by those who first
introduced it. In no subject, in short, is it more impor
tant for an author to be free from all tinge of antiquarian
pedantry.

But if I felt myself as fully competent to the task of writing
such a history of Logic as I have alluded to, as I am conscious
of not being so, I should still decidedly prefer keeping such a
work altogether distinct from a treatise on the science ; be
cause the combination of the two in a single volume would
render it the more difficult to avoid the blending of them con
fusedly together ; and also because, on such a plan, the dis
tinction could not be so easily preserved between Logic, in
the sense in which I am here using that title, and various met
aphysical disquisitions to which several writers have given the
same name.

For these reasons I have thought it best to take only a slight
and rapid glance of the scries of logical writers down to the
present day, and of the general tendency of their labors.`;
