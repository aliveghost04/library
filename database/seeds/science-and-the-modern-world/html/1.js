the name, may be considered as the Science,
and also as the Art, of Reasoning. It investigates the prin*
ciples on which argumentation is conducted, and furnishes
such rules as may be derived from those principles, for guard
ing against erroneous deductions. Its most appropriate office,
however, is that of instituting an analysis of the process of
the mind in Reasoning ; and in this point of view it is, as I
have said, strictly a Science; while, considered in reference
to the practical rules above mentioned, it may be called the
Art of Reasoning. For it is to be remembered, that as t&gt;
science is conversant about speculative knowledge only, and
art is the application of knowledge to practice, hence Logic
(as well as any other system of knowledge) becomes, when
applied to practice, an art ; while confined to the theory of
reasoning, it is strictly a science : and it is as such that it
occupies the higher place in point of dignity, since it professes

to develop some of the most interesting and curious intel

<p>
Considering how early Logic attracted the

<p>
Mistakes attention of philosophers, it may appear sur-
respecting prising that so little progress should have been
made, as is confessedly the case, in developing
its principles, and perfecting the detail of the system ; and
this circumstance has been brought forward as a proof of the
barrenness and futility of the study. But a similar argument
might have been urged with no less plausibility, at a period
not very remote, against the study of Natural Philosophy ;
and, very recently, against that of Chemistry. No science
can be expected to make any considerable progress, which is
not cultivated on right principles. Whatever may be the in
herent vigor of the plant, it will neither be flourishing nor
fruitful till it meet with a suitable soil and culture : and in no
case is the remark more applicable than in the present ; the
greatest mistakes having always prevailed respecting the
nature of Logic ; and its province having in consequence
been extended by many writers to subjects with which it nas
no proper connection. Indeed, with the exception perhaps of
Aristotle, (who is himself, however, not entirely exempt from
  the errors in question,) hardly a writer on Logic can be men
  tioned who has clearly perceived, and steadily kept in view
  throughout, its real nature and object. Before his time, no
  distinction was drawn between the science of which we are
  speaking, and that which is now usually called Metaphysics ;
  a circumstance which alone shows how small was the progress

<p>
* It is surely strange, therefore, to find in a treatise on Logic,
(Aldrich s,) a distinct dissertation to prove that it is an Art, and not
Science !</p>
